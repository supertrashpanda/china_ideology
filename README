My project aims to build an RShiny dashboard to visually illustrate the characteristic contour of popular belief in China by examining the two dimensions of mass ideology: the state-market economic attitudes and the authoritarian-democratic political attitudes. Specifically, I employ the dashboard graphics to show the macro-geographic and cross-cohort patterns. Nationally representative surveys have tapped into the cross-generational and regional variation of the political attitudes across the political and economic issue areas. By and large, the older cohorts subscribe more to pro-state economic orientation and authoritarian values (Wu, 2022). Given the diverse regional developmental and institutional conditions, one would expect the individual-level attitudinal outcomes also vary across provinces
